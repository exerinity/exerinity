This is where I dump some of my projects. I only use JavaScript for programming (for some reason), and most of the stuff I make is public domain, WTFPL, or GNU GPL. Because it's trash. Anyway...

# Things I made

- [**ex3**](https://exerinity.com/ex3): multi-functional bot with 60+ absolutely random commands
- [**pigeon**](https://exerinity.com/pigeon): AI chatbot bot
- **clifford**: private vanguard for my server
- [**elysion**](https://github.com/exerinity/elysion): extremely lightweight bot to display info about a guild and server (basically exposes some technical hidden info not shown by your client)
